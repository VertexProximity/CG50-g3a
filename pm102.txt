1. Algebra and Functions

1.1 Quadratic Equations:

Standard Form: ax^2 + bx + c = 0
Quadratic Formula: x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
Discriminant (Δ): Δ = b^2 - 4ac
If Δ > 0: 2 real distinct roots
If Δ = 0: 1 real repeated root
If Δ < 0: No real roots
1.2 Completing the Square:

To complete the square for ax^2 + bx + c: ax^2 + bx + c = a(x + b/2a)^2 - Δ / 4a
1.3 Factor Theorem:

If f(a) = 0, then (x - a) is a factor of f(x).
2. Coordinate Geometry

2.1 Equation of a Straight Line:

General form: y = mx + c

m is the gradient (slope).
c is the y-intercept.
Gradient between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2): m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

2.2 Midpoint of a Line Segment:

Midpoint = ((x1 + x2) / 2, (y1 + y2) / 2)
2.3 Distance Between Two Points:

Distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
2.4 Equation of a Circle:

Standard form: (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2
Center: (a, b)
Radius: r
3. Trigonometry

3.1 Basic Trigonometric Ratios:

sin(θ) = Opposite / Hypotenuse
cos(θ) = Adjacent / Hypotenuse
tan(θ) = Opposite / Adjacent
3.2 Exact Values:

sin(30°) = 1/2, cos(30°) = sqrt(3)/2, tan(30°) = 1/sqrt(3)
sin(45°) = 1/sqrt(2), cos(45°) = 1/sqrt(2), tan(45°) = 1
sin(60°) = sqrt(3)/2, cos(60°) = 1/2, tan(60°) = sqrt(3)
3.3 Trigonometric Identities:

Pythagorean Identity: sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1
tan(θ) = sin(θ) / cos(θ)
3.4 Sine Rule:

a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)
3.5 Cosine Rule:

c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(C)
3.6 Area of a Triangle (Using Sine):

Area = 1/2 * ab * sin(C)
4. Calculus

4.1 Differentiation:

Derivative of y = ax^n: dy/dx = n * ax^(n-1)

Equation of a Tangent to a curve at (x1, y1): y - y1 = m(x - x1)

where m is the gradient at the point, found by f'(x1).
4.2 Stationary Points:

A stationary point occurs where dy/dx = 0.
Maximum: d^2y/dx^2 < 0
Minimum: d^2y/dx^2 > 0
Point of inflection: d^2y/dx^2 = 0
4.3 Integration:

Integral of y = ax^n: ∫ ax^n dx = (a / (n+1)) * x^(n+1) + C

Definite Integrals: ∫ from a to b of f(x) dx represents the area under the curve between x = a and x = b.

5. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

5.1 Exponential Functions:

If y = e^x, then dy/dx = e^x.
5.2 Logarithmic Functions:

If y = ln(x), then dy/dx = 1/x.
5.3 Laws of Logarithms:

ln(ab) = ln(a) + ln(b)
ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)
ln(a^n) = n * ln(a)
6. Binomial Expansion

For (1 + x)^n, where n is a positive integer:

(1 + x)^n = 1 + nx + (n(n-1) / 2!) * x^2 + (n(n-1)(n-2) / 3!) * x^3 + ...
